## What is open source?

Open source projects are projects that allow any one using the project to freely modify and redistribute the project. Many people think that open source software must be publicly distributed, or distributed for free, but this is false. The Free in "Free and Open Source Software" refers to freedom, not price.

## What surprised me?

I'm pretty familiar with the open source world and with FOSS licensing, so not much surprised me, but I was surprised at a couple specific aspects of Open Source Initiative's definition. For instance "4. Integrity of The Author’s Source Code" has a couple specific carve outs to help differentiate between the original work and derivatives, which makes total sense, but I had never really thought about. The exclusion of licenses restricting specific areas also makes sense, but I'm curious how that interacts with export restrictions.

In the article on contributing to open source software, I was surprised that the article didn't mention checking for policies(i.e `Contributing.md`) on what contributions will be accepted, which would probably be one of the first things I would check. I would hate to spend a bunch of time prepping a contribution, only to have it rejected because of a rule I didn't know about. (I hear the Linux kernel is notorious for weird rules about how contributions should be submitted, besides the whole "getting called a moron by Linus" thing)

## Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?

Companies using open source:
- Goldman Sachs
- Walmart
- ExxonMobil
- Google
  - Android
  - Tensorflow
  - Chromium
  - Contributes to 28K other projects as of 2019
- Apple
  - CUPS(Print server used by MacOS, as well as most Linux and Unix based systems)
  - WebKit(Core of Safari, precursor to Chromium)
- Microsoft
- Adobe

Even companies often associated with walled gardens and proprietary systems make heavy use of open source code, and in many cases, are required by the terms of the license to share changes under the same terms, with those changes often pushed back up to the original project, either directly by the company, or indirectly via maintainers. This means thousands of organizations around the world, many of whom have never even heard of each other much less formally agreed to collaborate, are all working towards common goals of improving software. As both a consumer and nerd(a phrase I only use in a positive sense), this is incredibly beneficial because it gives me access to a large collection of production quality software that I am free to adopt for any purpose I choose. This also reduces the startup costs for new projects, since they don't have to reinvent the wheel or spend large amounts of money on proprietary solutions that may or may not be interoperable.
